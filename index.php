  <p>You can do whatever you want with a child theme as long as the parent file is in the root folder.</p>
  <p>By example, this is index.php so you could copy and paste every code inside the original index.php here. What ever you add or, remove, here, will not change the original file. So updates will be mostly flawless, and you can keep your customizations.</p>
  <p>Please take a look at the oficial documentation</p>

  <p>Another good example is a templates. You can create a file named equals as the original template file in the parent theme and edit what ever you want.</p>
